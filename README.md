# Homework 2: DNA analysis

# This program reads in DNA sequencer output and computes statistics, such as
# the GC content.  Run it from the command line like this:
#   python dna_analysis.py myfile.fastq

# to explain in detail what some Python constructs are doing.

# The sys module supports reading files, command-line arguments, etc.
